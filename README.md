You have created a table of your choice with relevant fields (Assignment 1a) and retrieved data from this table (Assignment 1b). You are now looking to update and delete data of/from this table. Add relevant UPDATE and DELETE statements at the end of the Assignment (1a + 1b), <strong>clearly commenting the functionality of each of them</strong>. Think of what type of updates and deletes can occur on the table data in a real life scenario and come up with associated statements for them. You can insert more relevant records in the table if you require to do so.

<strong>Important Note: Use literal text data in quotes, numeric data without quotes and CAST literals to DATE wherever required. You will lose marks if you do not follow this instruction.</strong>

Write 8 UPDATE statements, one for each criteria given below. <strong>Number them to match the criteria number 1, 2… etc in comments clearly stating the purpose of each update statement</strong>. Refer to scripts I have provided on blackboard.

<ol>

 <li>Only one column is updated in a single record using the primary key</li>

 <li>Only one column is updated in some, but not all, records</li>

 <li>One update statement only to set more than one column/field in a single record without using the primary key</li>

 <li>One update statement only to set more than one column/field in some, but not all, records</li>

 <li>One or more fields/columns are updated in ALL records</li>

 <li>SET involves a mathematical operation</li>

 <li>SET sets a field value to NULL of one or more, but not all records (obviously, this field cannot be defined with NOT NULL in its definition)</li>

</ol>

Note: If you do not have a NOT NULL field, just change the definition of a relevant field by removing NOT NULL and leave a comment for me that you changed it for this update.

<ol start="8">

 <li>A statement with SET, WHERE, ORDER BY and LIMIT</li>

</ol>







Now add 6 DELETE statements, one for each criteria given below. <strong>Number them to match the criteria number 9, 10… etc in comments clearly stating the purpose of each delete statement</strong>. Refer to scripts I have provided on blackboard.




<ol start="9">

 <li>WHERE condition involves a compound condition, each simple condition using a relational operator</li>

 <li>WHERE condition uses the NOT Boolean operator</li>

 <li>WHERE condition uses BETWEEN with a DATE or CHAR/VARCHAR field</li>

 <li>WHERE condition checks for NULL or NOT NULL on a certain field</li>

 <li>WHERE works with a DATE field data (do not forget to CAST the literal value)</li>

 <li>A statement with WHERE, ORDER BY and LIMIT</li>

</ol>
